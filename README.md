Hello Ms. Stacy Maresco,

Good day and thank you for reaching out to me. I am very excited to explore this opportunity with you and your team. As part of the initial process, I am completing all the tasks as per your email. I am new to GitHub, but I am confident and quick to learn so I can manage and use this tool and its potential.

I will be completing the other tasks and reply back following the link that's given on your email.

This marks the completion of Step 2 of your email.

thanks
